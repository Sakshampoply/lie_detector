# lie_detector

Introduction:

The aim of this project is to design and build a simple lie detector using an Arduino Nano board. The device will use jumper cables to measure changes in a person's skin conductance, which can indicate whether they are telling the truth or lying. The project will involve building the circuit, programming the Arduino board, and testing the device to see how well it works.

Materials:

1.Arduino Nano board
2.Jumper wires
3.Breadboard
4.Resistors
5.LED lights (green, red, yellow)

Programming:

The Arduino board will need to be programmed to read the signals from the jumper wires and analyze them to detect changes that may indicate deception. The programming language used for this project is Arduino IDE, and the code will involve using the built-in analog input pins to read the sensor values and implementing logic to interpret the data.

Testing:

Once the circuit is built and the code is written, the device can be tested by having a person tell lies while monitoring their physiological responses. The baseline measurement will be taken before the testing, and the results will be compared to this baseline to determine if there are significant changes in the person's pulse and skin conductance levels.

Conclusion:

Overall, this project demonstrates how an Arduino Nano board can be used to create a simple lie detector device using physiological sensors. The accuracy of the device may not be as reliable as professional-grade lie detectors used in law enforcement, but it can be a fun and educational project for those interested in electronics and psychology.
